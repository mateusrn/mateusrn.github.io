# Data Science

I'm revisiting a model deployed about a year ago. It's a classification problem with 12 heavily imbalanced classes. In order to improve our model, we're first diving deep into the details of its misclassifications. In broad terms, we're working to assess the relevance of the following three factors: noisy target, noisy variables and sample size for certain classes. It's a challenging and exciting project. Hopefully we'll have the opportunity to work on new approaches to an optimization issue (perhaps more on that soon).

# Mathematics

It's summer break. Next semester I'm taking Abstract Algebra II. So why not review some topics from AA I? We're talking rings and fields. The basics, nat√ºrlich.

On top of that, there are a few important topics about finite dimensional normed spaces which I was supposed to have covered last semester. Better late than never, right?. I plan to study compactness and bit of linear operators and linear functionals. Thankfully Erwin Kreyszig has such a fluid and light-hearted style. This makes my job a little easier.
