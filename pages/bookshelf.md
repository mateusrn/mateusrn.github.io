### Aspiration: the agency of becoming
_by Agnes Callard_

<img align="center" width="75" src="/assets/img/books/aspiration_callard.jpg" />

A wonderful account of the rationality behind working to become a different person. Quite heavy for non-philosophers. Hopefully I'm not deluding myself into thinking I understand the book.
