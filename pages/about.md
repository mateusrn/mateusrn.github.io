Hi, thank you for visiting my little corner of the web!
{: style="text-align: justify"}

I'm a senior data scientist and math student with a philosophical bent. I live in [Blumenau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blumenau) with my beautiful wife and our two dogs. When I'm not taming machine learning models, I enjoy proving theorems, playing with the gymnastics rings and cooking for friends and family.

In this blog I write micro posts about math, data science and the good life. But the real goal here is to learn how to think about those subjects. Check out the [inaugural post](/_posts/2024-02-10-welcome-to-think.md) to see what I mean by that.

Oh, and by the way: all photos were taken by me. I really like them.
