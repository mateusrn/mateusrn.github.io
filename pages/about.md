Hi, thank you for visiting my little corner of the web!

I'm a senior data scientist and math student with a philosophical bent. I live in [Blumenau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blumenau) with my beautiful wife and our two dogs. When I'm not taming machine learning models, I enjoy proving theorems, playing with the gymnastics rings and cooking for friends and family.

If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateus-rigo-noriller-093991172/) or at `<myfirstname><mylastname>@gmail.com`.
