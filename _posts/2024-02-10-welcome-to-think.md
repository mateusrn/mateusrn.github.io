What will this be all about?

I'm on a quest to learn how to think. Don't get me wrong. I know we do it instinctively. But there are two dimensions about thinking which deserve some attention: quantity and quality. I have the impression that most human beings think too much, almost compulsively. And often when we actually do need to think hard, when things get really complicated and confusing, we get stuck. Stuck with no answer to our questions. Or stuck with the wrong answers, which is even worse.

My goal is to be able to find mental clarity in such situations. And to find it because we know how and where to look for it, not by accident. To think ***well*** when thinking is the right tool for the job and to rest when it's not. To spend less time being lost in thought.

How am I going to get there? I don't know. Right now I'm kinda stuck with no answers. But I do have a strategy in mind. I call it the "meta approach".

I've noticed that we tend to overlook thinking skills. We talk quite naturally about math skills, programming skills, communication skills and so on. When we're stuck in, say, a math problem, we tend to think it's due to a limitation in our knowledge about math (or about how to do math). We focus on what's immediately in front of us. Fair enough. Sometimes that's the case. But I suspect that stuckness in math and stuckness in programming may have something more fundamental in common, some underlying condition not immediately visible.

There's an imperfect analogy which I find illuminating. In the context of sports, it's easy to see that gymnastics and swimming are specific types of a more general entity. We can call it "human movement". Indeed, they're both about moving the body in certain ways so as to achieve certain goals. The mastery of domain-specific techniques is obviously at the core of the practice. But every serious gymnast or swimmer knows that her performance is also determined by factors such as strength, mobility, endurance capacity, flexibility, motor control, etc. These are general enough that they don't qualify as sports on their own. They're the fundamental dimensions of human movement. The fact that athletes spend serious amounts of time at the gym lifting weights, for example, requires no justification. We all get it.

In contrast, when it comes to thinking our attitude is markedly different. Programming and math are activities of the intellect: we perform both by means of thinking. But we don't seem to notice or to care about the possibility that there may be fundamental dimensions of thinking which play critical roles when we engage with math or programming. I suspect that some of the stuckness we experience in such activities stems from weaknesses in our general thinking toolbox. And if that's true, it naturally sets an agenda for how we can become better thinkers. Sounds promising, doesn't it?
{: style="text-align: justify"}

Clearly there are two major challenges ahead. The first one is to identify the fundamental dimensions of thinking. What general skills or processes are we talking about, really? The second challenge is to assess their practical value. Can a given general skill be targeted and improved? And will improvement in general skills carry over to domain-specific activities?

As far as I can see, the only way we can make progress here is by ***thinking about thinking***. Hence the meta approach. For some reason, the meta nature of these questions makes them even more beautiful. I honestly don't know if I'll ever get to answer any of them. Maybe they'll prove meaningless in some sense. Maybe I won't have the resources to work on them. But they're screaming for attention. And they're beautiful. So why not ***think*** about them?
